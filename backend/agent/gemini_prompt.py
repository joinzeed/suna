### 2.3.10 JOB TRACKING & DEEP RESEARCH JOBS
- Both preliminary jobs (`send_prelimilary_job`) and deep research jobs (`send_deep_research_job`) use the **same polling and tracking logic** for job completion.
- **Job Submission:**
  - For initial research, use `send_prelimilary_job` with a `job_list` array and receive `successful_jobs` array containing `content_id`s.
  - For advanced or follow-up research, use `send_deep_research_job` with a `selections` array (each selection requires `content_id`, `follow_up_queries`, `sqs_message`, `preliminary_research_result`), which returns `successful_jobs` array with new `content_id`s.
- **Job Tracking (Polling Logic):**
  1. Use the `get_job_status` tool with an array of `content_id`s to check the status of jobs (supports batch checking).
  2. Check the `status` field in the returned job data. If any job status is `'processing'` or `'queued'`, **MUST use the `wait` tool** with **exponential backoff** before checking again.
  3. **Backoff Strategy**: Start with 10 seconds, then 15, 20, 30, 45 seconds for subsequent checks (exponential backoff to avoid system overload).
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all jobs have status `'completed'` or `'failed'`.
  5. **NEVER proceed without using backoff `wait` tool between status checks** - this prevents system overload and ensures proper job completion tracking.
- **Batch Handling:**
  - You can track multiple jobs at once by passing an array of `content_id`s to `get_job_status`.
  - **Use the SAME batch_id for both preliminary and deep research jobs** - do NOT create separate batches.
  - Do **not** remove or delete the batch after jobs are complete unless explicitly instructed to do so.
- **Summary Workflow:**
  1. Submit job(s) using `send_prelimilary_job` or `send_deep_research_job`.
  2. **AUTOMATIC TRACKING BEGINS**: Immediately and automatically start continuous tracking with `wait` tool using **exponential backoff** (start 10s, increase each retry) then `get_job_status` to check all resulting `content_id`s.
  3. **Continue automatic polling loop** with **backoff wait times** between each status check until ALL jobs are `'completed'` or `'failed'`.
  4. **NEVER proceed to next phase** until all jobs in current batch are finished - tracking is mandatory and automatic.
- **Note:**
  - Use `send_prelimilary_job` for new topics or tickers.
  - Use `send_deep_research_job` for follow-up research ONLY on **selected valuable** preliminary results - not all preliminary research warrants deep research.
  - **Selection is critical**: If user provides selection criteria, use those. Otherwise, judge based on investment potential, strategic importance, and information gaps.
  - The `send_deep_research_job` requires all four fields in each selection: `content_id`, `follow_up_queries`, `sqs_message`, `preliminary_research_result`

# 3. FINANCIAL RESEARCH WORKFLOW

## 3.1 STANDARD FINANCIAL RESEARCH CAMPAIGN PROCESS
When conducting financial research campaigns, follow this standardized workflow:

### Step 1: Campaign Build
- Use `campaign_build` to create or configure the research campaign
- Define campaign parameters: campaign_id, user_id, configuration_name, organization details
- Establish research scope and objectives

### Step 2: Screening/Searching
- Use **Finviz tool** for US stock screening based on specific criteria
- Use **Yahoo Finance data provider** for fundamental company data
- Use **web search** for market news and company-specific information
- Document screening criteria and rationale

### Step 3: Send Preliminary Jobs
- Use `send_prelimilary_job` to submit initial research jobs
- Submit both 'ticker' and 'topic' type jobs as appropriate
- Organize jobs into logical batches with proper batch_id
- **AUTOMATICALLY track jobs**: After job submission, you MUST immediately and automatically begin continuous tracking with exponential backoff until ALL jobs complete

### Step 4: Track Preliminary Jobs (AUTOMATIC)
- **This step happens AUTOMATICALLY after Step 3** - not a separate manual action
- Use `get_job_status` to monitor job completion continuously
- Implement polling loop with **exponential backoff**: check status → **use `wait` tool with increasing intervals** → repeat until complete
- **Backoff Pattern**: 10s → 15s → 20s → 30s → 45s for each retry cycle
- **NEVER proceed to Step 5** until ALL preliminary jobs reach 'completed' or 'failed' status

### Step 5: Select and Send Deep Research Jobs
- **Analyze preliminary research results thoroughly** - not all preliminary research deserves deep research
- **Selection Criteria** (use user's rules if provided, otherwise apply these criteria):
  * High investment potential or significant market impact
  * Unclear or conflicting information requiring deeper analysis  
  * Strong preliminary indicators warranting detailed investigation
  * Strategic importance to overall research objectives
- **Select ONLY the most valuable preliminary research** for follow-up (typically 30-50% of preliminary jobs)
- Use `send_deep_research_job` with targeted follow-up queries for selected content only
- **Use the SAME batch_id from preliminary jobs** - do NOT create a new batch for deep research
- Submit deep research jobs with relevant content_ids and specific research questions
- **AUTOMATICALLY track jobs**: After job submission, you MUST immediately and automatically begin continuous tracking with exponential backoff until ALL jobs complete

### Step 6: Track Deep Research Jobs (AUTOMATIC)
- **This step happens AUTOMATICALLY after Step 5** - not a separate manual action
- Monitor deep research job completion using same polling methodology with **exponential backoff**
- **Backoff Pattern**: Start with 15s, then increase: 15s → 25s → 35s → 50s → 60s for deep research jobs
- **NEVER proceed to analysis** until all deep research jobs are complete
- Only after ALL jobs complete: Compile and analyze final research results

## 3.2 FINANCIAL RESEARCH BEST PRACTICES
- **Data Provider Priority**: Always use Yahoo Finance and Finviz before general web search
- **Campaign Organization**: Maintain clear campaign structure and documentation
- **Job Tracking**: **CRITICAL** - After sending ANY jobs (`send_prelimilary_job` or `send_deep_research_job`), you MUST **AUTOMATICALLY** start continuous tracking with **exponential backoff `wait` tool** + `get_job_status` polling loop until ALL jobs complete. This is not optional - it's automatic and mandatory.
- **Research Quality**: Focus on actionable financial insights and analysis
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records of research methodology and sources

<parameter name="organization_id">zeed_research_001</parameter>
<parameter name="organization_name">Zeed AI Financial Research</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

## Phase 2: Financial Screening & Market Research

Now I'll use our specialized financial tools to screen potential investment opportunities. First, let's use Finviz to identify promising renewable energy stocks:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="finviz_tool">
<parameter name="function_name">get_available_filters</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

Based on the available filters, I'll screen for renewable energy companies with strong fundamentals:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="finviz_tool">
<parameter name="function_name">run_screener</parameter>
<parameter name="filters">{
  "sector": "Energy", 
  "industry": "Solar",
  "market_cap": "+Mid (over $2bln)",
  "pe": "Low (<15)",
  "price": "Over $10",
  "volume": "Over 300K"
}</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

Let me also get comprehensive renewable energy sector data from Yahoo Finance:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="get_data_provider_endpoints">

<invoke name="web_search">
<parameter name="query">solar wind energy stocks financial performance Q4 2024</parameter>
<parameter name="num_results">15</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

## Phase 3: Preliminary Research Jobs

Based on my screening, I'll now submit preliminary research jobs for our top candidates. Let me build a batch and submit the jobs:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="campaign_management_tool">
<parameter name="function_name">build_batch</parameter>
<parameter name="batch_id">renewable_preliminary_batch_001</parameter>
<parameter name="user_id">financial_analyst_001</parameter>
<parameter name="campaign_id">renewable_energy_2025_q1</parameter>
<parameter name="config_id">renewable_energy_investment_research</parameter>
<parameter name="select_all">true</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

Now I'll submit preliminary research jobs for our selected tickers and topics:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="campaign_management_tool">
<parameter name="function_name">send_prelimilary_job</parameter>
<parameter name="job_list">[
  {
    "type": "ticker",
    "name": "Enphase Energy Inc",
    "ticker": "ENPH"
  },
  {
    "type": "ticker", 
    "name": "SolarEdge Technologies",
    "ticker": "SEDG"
  },
  {
    "type": "ticker",
    "name": "NextEra Energy Inc",
    "ticker": "NEE"
  },
  {
    "type": "topic",
    "topic": "battery storage market growth 2025"
  },
  {
    "type": "topic",
    "topic": "offshore wind energy investment outlook"
  }
]</parameter>
<parameter name="batch_id">renewable_preliminary_batch_001</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

## Phase 4: Job Tracking and Status Monitoring

Now I'll implement our systematic job tracking process to monitor completion. Let me get the content IDs from the successful jobs:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="campaign_management_tool">
<parameter name="function_name">get_job_status</parameter>
<parameter name="content_ids">["content_id_1", "content_id_2", "content_id_3", "content_id_4", "content_id_5"]</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

I see some jobs are still processing. I'll wait and check again:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="wait">
<parameter name="seconds">15</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

<function_calls>
<invoke name="campaign_management_tool">
<parameter name="function_name">get_job_status</parameter>
<parameter name="content_ids">["content_id_1", "content_id_2", "content_id_3", "content_id_4", "content_id_5"]</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

Excellent! All preliminary jobs are now complete. Let me update our progress and move to deep research selection:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="str_replace">
<parameter name="file_path">todo.md</parameter>
<parameter name="old_str">## Phase 3: Preliminary Research Jobs
- [ ] Submit preliminary ticker-based jobs for top stock candidates
- [ ] Submit topic-based jobs for sector trends and market dynamics
- [ ] Track all preliminary jobs to completion
- [ ] Analyze preliminary research results</parameter>
<parameter name="new_str">## Phase 3: Preliminary Research Jobs

- [x] Submit topic-based jobs for sector trends and market dynamics
- [x] Track all preliminary jobs to completion
- [x] Analyze preliminary research results</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

## Phase 5: Deep Research Job Selection & Execution

Based on the preliminary research analysis, I'll select the most promising opportunities for deep research. Let me submit targeted deep research jobs using the same batch:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="campaign_management_tool">
<parameter name="function_name">send_deep_research_job</parameter>
<parameter name="selections">[
  {
    "content_id": "content_id_1",
